## What is FIRST?
FIRST stands for *For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology*. Founded by Dean Kamen in 1989, FIRST has, over the past 20+ years, generated interest in the science and technology fields in many students through its various programs, including FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition), FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge), and FLL (FIRST LEGO League).

## In the Community
Team 2876 is active outside of FRC competitions as well. Since 2011, our team has been mentoring students in after school and summer programs in all four elementary schools in our town of Burlington, MA. As of 2016, we also started FLL (First LEGO League) teams in Burlington’s Marshall Simonds Middle School. We are also active participants in local events, such as Burlington Pride Day and the 4th of July Parade.

## Development
### Language
We use Java built off of the wpilib library to develop our robot for the FIRST© 2021 competition.

## Sponsers

Team 2876 can’t build a robot without tools and parts. We can’t go to competitions without travel expenses. In 2017, several long-time sponsors have reduced, discontinued, or changed the qualifications for their giving. As a result, Team 2876 needs more financial sponsors! Would your company like to have its logo on our robot and here on this page? Please Contact Us!

#### Food Sponsors
Food sponsors provide vital and much-appreciated sustenance during the team’s strenuous build season. For the six-week period, students and mentors meet not only three nights during the business week but all day on Saturdays and occasionally on Sundays. Our wonderful food sponsors provide breakfast foods to give us energy to get started and lunch foods to keep us going through the end of the day.

The simple leap from an open fire to a more controlled heating process expanded the culinary possibilities for all mankind. We rolled into the picture in 1998, going back, in order to move forward. Since then, the Flatbread Company has been introducing people to the magic of earth and fire, and how that combination can produce incredible tasting pizza."
